        <p>
            This website was developed as a personal portfolio using only HTML and CSS.
            The aim of the website is to demonstrate my understanding of basic web
            development concepts such as semantic HTML, layout design, and responsive
            styling.
        </p>

        <p>
            The site consists of multiple pages including Home, Projects, Video Demo,
            Contact, and Site Report. A consistent navigation bar and footer are used
            throughout the site for better usability.
        </p>

        <p>
            Responsive design techniques such as Flexbox, Grid, and media queries were
            used to ensure the website works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
