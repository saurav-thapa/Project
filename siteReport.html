            <h1>Site Report</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This site report explains the structure, design approach, and development process of my personal
                portfolio website. The website was created using only HTML and CSS, focusing on clean code,
                responsiveness, and accessibility.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="design">
            <h2>Design & Development</h2>
            <p>
                The website uses a consistent layout across all pages with a navigation bar at the top and a footer
                at the bottom. HTML semantic elements such as <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code>,
                <code>section</code>, and <code>footer</code> are used to improve readability and structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS Flexbox and Grid are used to control layout and alignment. Media queries ensure the design is
                responsive, adapting smoothly to both desktop and mobile screen sizes. A simple color scheme and
                readable fonts were chosen to maintain a professional appearance.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="validation">
    <h2>Validation</h2>
    <p>
        All HTML and CSS files were validated using the W3C HTML and CSS Validators.
        The following screenshots show successful validation results for different pages
        of the website.

        <section id="video-demo">
            <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>
            <p>
                A video demonstration page is included to show how the website works, including navigation,
                responsiveness, and layout changes on different screen sizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The video is embedded using an <code>iframe</code> and styled using CSS to maintain proper aspect
                ratio without affecting the overall layout.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, this portfolio website demonstrates the effective use of HTML and CSS to build a
                responsive and well-structured website. Challenges such as layout alignment and responsiveness were
                solved using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries, resulting in a functional and standards-compliant
                website.
